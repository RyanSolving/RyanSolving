### My Journey into Data 💡

My path to data analytics wasn't conventional. After four years in **sales**, I realized my passion lay in understanding the 'why' behind customer behaviour and business trends. This led me to pursue a Master's in Business Analytics in Melbourne.

My sales background shapes how I see data – not just as numbers on a spreadsheet, but as a powerful lens to **uncover opportunities, build relationships, and drive optimization**. Statistical formulas, for me, are practical tools for finding truth in the noise.

### Shedding Light on Retail Insights 🛒

Working part-time in a large supermarket sparked my fascination with how data influences everyday retail experiences. I observed firsthand how the customer's insights underlying the data:

*   🥭 Displaying the **red side of mangoes** often led to higher sales (perceived as sweeter).
*   🍇 **Green, shiny grapes** consistently outsold yellowish ones (perceived as fresher).

These real-world examples solidified my belief that even small, data-informed decisions can have a significant business impact.

### From Curiosity to Actionable Insights: A Self-Driven Project 📊

As a regular shopper at major supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths, I became curious about broader customer sentiment. I initiated a **self-funded project** analyzing Google reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:

*   **Goal:** Understand key themes and satisfaction drivers.
*   **Methods:** Employed topic modeling and association rule mining.
*   **Key Finding:** While product quality and staff friendliness were appreciated, the **self-checkout experience** emerged as a common pain point, offering a clear area for potential improvement and competitive benchmarking.

### Bridging Domain Knowledge and Technical Skills 🛠️

I thrive on **solving the right problems efficiently**. My blend of sales domain knowledge and data analysis skills allows me to manage end-to-end data processes:

*   **Analytics Spectrum:** Comfortable with descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
*   **Technical Toolkit:** Proficient in **SQL** (querying), **Python** (analysis, modeling), and **Power BI** (visualization) to support data-driven decision-making.

I'm always eager to apply these skills to uncover insights and contribute to impactful solutions. Feel free to explore my projects below!
